= Edge Documentation

Edge is a starting point for creating Clojure projects.
Not sure if Edge is for you? See <<why-edge.adoc#,Why Edge?>>.

This new documentation is a WIP of the old documentation.
The <<old/index.adoc#,old documentation>> is still available, and largely relevant.

What follows is largely a framework for filling out documentation.
