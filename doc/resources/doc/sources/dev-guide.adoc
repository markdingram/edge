Through the `lib.app.dev` module, a common enhanced application dev experience is provided.
Future versions of edge can update the dev experience through this module, without requiring you to update projects to take advantage of them.

[[setup]]
== Setup

If you've used the edge app template, you can skip to <<quick_start>>.

Otherwise, you need to:

. Make a `dev` directory
+
[source,shell]
----
acme.api$ mkdir dev
----
. Create a dev alias in deps.edn which depends on `lib.app.dev` and your `dev` directory.
+
[source,clojure]
----
:aliases
{:dev
 {:extra-paths ["dev"]
  :extra-deps
  {juxt.edge/lib.app.dev {:local/root "../lib.app.dev"}}}}
----
. Create `dev/log_dev_app.properties` with your root namespace. This is used for only showing you logs relating to your application
+
[source,shell]
----
acme.api$ echo 'app_root_logger=acme.api' > dev/log_dev_app.properties
----
. Create `dev/dev.clj` with a boilerplate bringing in lib.app.dev
+
[source,clojure]
----
(ns dev
  (:require
    [dev-extras :refer :all]))
----
. Create a `.dir-locals.el` containing your dev jack-in aliases
+
[source,elisp]
----
((nil
  (cider-clojure-cli-global-options . "-A:dev:build:dev/build")))
----

[[quick_start]]
== Quick Start

Generally REPL session will start like so:

[source,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (dev) ;; <1>
dev=> (reset)
:reloading (pro.juxt.edge.demo.foo)
:resumed
----
<1> This is done automatically when using `../bin/rebel`

[[usage]]
== lib.app.dev reference

=== `dev` functions and vars

`dev`:: If you're in the `user` namespace, use this to swtich to `dev`.
+
[souce,clojure-repl]
----
user=> (dev)
----
`reset`:: Use this to start the system, and after making code changes.  It will reload your code, and your system.
+
[source,clojure-repl]
----
dev=> (reset)
:reloading (pro.juxt.edge.demo.foo)
:resumed
----
`go`:: Use this to start the system without reloading your code. You might choose to do this if you're trying to be quick. But `(reset)` will result in the same outcome regardless of whether you have already started with `(go)`.
`cljs-repl`:: Use this to switch to a Clojurescript-connected REPL, if you have figwheel available.
`add-lib`:: Use this to hot-load a library into your running environment.
+
[source,clojure-repl]
----
dev=> (add-lib 'hiccup {:mvn/version "2.0.0-alpha1"})
true
----
`system` and `system-config`:: These give you insight into the integrant system & configuration. Very useful for debugging.

=== Logs

During development, we have crafted a special logging mechanism.
It's based heavily on link:https://github.com/stuartsierra/log.dev[Stuart Sierra's log.dev].
The design is to show you the relevant information most of the time, and have the rest available one hop away. 

All logs from namespaces under your application prefix (set in `log_dev_app.properties`) are printed to the console.
Warning and Error logs from all namespaces are logged to the console too.

Your application's logs are also written to `log/app.log` for later reference.
All logs from all namespaces are written to `log/all.log`.
These files are rotated to ensure they don't completely consume your disk over time.

== Enhanced Shell REPL (Rebel)

There is also a handy `../bin/rebel` script, which will launch a repl in any application, using link:https://github.com/bhauman/rebel-readline[Bruce Hauman's rebel-readline].

It supports a number of flags, these must be supplied before arguments to `clj`:

`--nrepl`:: Start an nrepl on port 5600 with CIDER and Refactor pre-configured.
`--cljs`:: Start with clojurescript support for rebel

You use it like so:

[source,shell]
----
acme.app$ ../bin/rebel --cljs -A:dev:build:dev/build
[Edge] Starting development environment, please waitâ€¦
[Rebel readline] Type :repl/help for online help info
[Edge] Loading Clojure code, please wait...
[Edge] Now enter (go) to start the dev system
dev=> (reset)
...
----

== CIDER jack-in

`cider-jack-in` will just work provided you create a `.dir-locals.el` as documented in <<setup>>.
This is automatically created with the template.

== REPLant.nvim

REPLant's refresh is fully compatible with this setup and will work automatically.
