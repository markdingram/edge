= Serving web requests with bidi and [.yada]#yada#

Edge has a full web stack built-in, using JUXT's bidi and [.yada]#yada# libraries.

Bidi is a data-driven router. Further information can be found on bidi's https://github.com/juxt/bidi[GitHub project page].

Let's see how Edge implements the classic 'Hello World!' example. srcloc:edge.hello/hello-routes[titlecase] contains a function which
returns a bidi route, which is always vector containing a couple of elements footnote:[The route returned forms part of a later data structure, but this does not concern us here].

include::srcblk:edge.hello/hello-routes[]

The first element is a pattern, in this case, `"/hello"`.

[#hello]
.Hello World! with [.yada]#yada#
