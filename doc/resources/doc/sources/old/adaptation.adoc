== Create a new "app"

From the root of the repo, run the `./bin/app` script.
It can be run with an optional flags which add support for Sass or Clojurescript, these are `--sass` and `--cljs` respectively.

[NOTE]
====
Your project name should be namespaced to match your application.
If your company was named "Acme" you might use "acme/api" or "com.acme/api".

If you're unsure, use your company name.
There's a low chance of conflicts in an application.

The project namespace will determine the Clojure namespaces within your application.

$ ./bin/app acme/api
$ ./bin/app acme/blog --sass
$ ./bin/app acme/dashboard --cljs
$ ./bin/app acme/radar --sass --cljs

== Code

Keep around the additional libraries and integrations in edge around for as long as possible.
They're full of useful knowledge, and you never know when you might need to refer to them.
There's no harm in them sitting there if you never depend on them.

== Documentation

We think it's a good idea to continue to document your project as we've done with Edge. You might want to update the CSS stylesheet, source highlighting and other Asiidoctor attributes. They can be found in `doc/resources/doc/asciidoctor/attributes.edn`.

=== Updating the footer in HTML documentation

If the footer has a copyright declaration from JUXT, you can update
this by updating `doc/resources/doc/docinfo/docinfo-footer.html`. This
file name must not be changed as it is looked for by Asciidoctorj when
generating the HTML output.
